# Nixos Configuration
This is my starter nixos configuration, still alot of learn and improve on but this is the foundation.

Currently, it only supports my laptop but the goal is to convert my desktop and server to nixos as well using the same configurations. 

# TODO
- Add a script to choose a random wall paper and apply a theme from wallust

- Add git aliases
- Look into impermanance for nixos
- Set up syncthing with server, and main machine
- set up multimachine flake config
